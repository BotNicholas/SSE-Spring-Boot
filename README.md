# About the project

This is a simple project where I'm getting more familiar with Server Sent Events (SSE), write simple Spring Boot application
that allows me to test this functionality and add a simple HTML & JS that communicates with these SSE endpoints.

# About the OtpController

This is a test controller which is used to generate a new otp and log it on the BE, get the SSE source to receive events and to confirm the OTP.
For testing purposes all the functionality is implemented on a single page, but OTP confirmation can be triggered from a separate page.
